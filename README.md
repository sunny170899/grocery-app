# Shopping application using React

This repository contains a React-based web application with a backend setup for dynamic content handling. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js**  
   Download and install Node.js from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).  
   Ensure that both `node` and `npm` commands are available in the terminal by checking their versions:  
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Install Visual Studio Code**  
   Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
   Install the following extensions for a smoother development experience:
   - ESLint
   - Prettier
   - React Developer Tools (optional)

---

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
Use the following command to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this GitHub repository.

### 2. Navigate to the Base Directory
Switch to the downloaded repository's base directory:
```bash
cd <repository-name>
```
Replace `<repository-name>` with the folder name created by the `git clone` command.

---

## Running the Client

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install all necessary packages for the client:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Client**  
   Start the client-side development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   By default, the client runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Running the Backend

1. **Navigate to Backend Folder**  
   Open a new terminal and move to the backend directory under the `src` folder:
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required packages for the backend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Backend Server**  
   Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   By default, the backend server runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Managing Port Conflicts

If the default ports (3000 for the client, 5000 for the server) are already in use, identify and terminate the conflicting processes.

### Check Port Usage
Use the following command to check which process is using the port:
```bash
lsof -i :<port-number>
```
Replace `<port-number>` with either `3000` or `5000`.

### Kill the Process
Kill the process using the port:
```bash
kill -9 <process-id>
```
Replace `<process-id>` with the `PID` obtained from the `lsof` command.

---

## Summary of Commands

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### Setup and Run Client
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Setup and Run Backend
```bash
cd src/backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Manage Port Conflicts
```bash
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <process-id>
lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <process-id>
```

---

## Notes
- Ensure `Node.js` and `npm` are properly installed and updated.
- Use separate terminals for running the client and backend servers.
- If needed, refer to the official documentation for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/).
